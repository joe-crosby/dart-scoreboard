# dart-scoreboard
This scoreboard uses a custom clickable dart board.

The user will use the 'Select Game' drop down to select the game of choice. Then the user will select the options for the game (if any, e.g. double in and double out). Then the players will bull up to determine the player order. Finally the user will add all the players by typing their name into the provided text box and pressing enter/return on a virtual or real keyboard. Once all players are added, the user will press the 'Start Game' button to start the game.

After a player shoots their darts, they will click the scoreboard to view the virtual clickable dart board and click each position where their darts hit on the real board. After 3 selections, the user is prompted if they have clicked the correct dart board positions. If not they get to redo all 3 darts, otherwise the scoreboard is updated accordingly.
